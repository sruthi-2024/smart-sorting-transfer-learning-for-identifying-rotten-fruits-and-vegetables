### Abstract

Sorting fruits and vegetables by their freshness is an essential task in agriculture and the food industry. Manual inspection is often inefficient, subjective, and inconsistent. This project aims to implement a smart sorting system using deep learning and transfer learning that can classify fresh and rotten produce based on image analysis. We utilize a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), fine-tuned for our dataset, to detect rot in various fruits and vegetables. The trained model can later be integrated into real-time applications, such as automated sorting machines.

### Objectives

* To detect and classify fresh vs. rotten fruits and vegetables using image data.
* To implement transfer learning with a pre-trained model like MobileNetV2 or ResNet50.
* To develop a robust and efficient classification model with high accuracy.
* To prototype a real-time fruit/vegetable sorting system.

### Technologies and Tools Used

* Programming Language: Python
* Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
* Hardware (optional): Raspberry Pi, Servo Motor, Camera Module
* IDE: Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

### Dataset Description

We used the Kaggle dataset "Fruit and Vegetable Image Recognition" which contains labeled images of various fruits and vegetables in both fresh and rotten conditions. The dataset includes categories like:

* Apple (Fresh, Rotten)
* Banana (Fresh, Rotten)
* Tomato (Fresh, Rotten)

Data preprocessing steps:

* Resizing images to 224x224 pixels
* Normalizing pixel values
* Applying data augmentation (rotation, flipping, zoom)

---

### Methodology

*1. Preprocessing:*

* Loaded the dataset and labeled classes.
* Split into training (80%) and validation (20%) sets.
* Applied image augmentation to increase data diversity.

*2. Model Architecture:*

* Used MobileNetV2 as the base model.
* Removed the top layer and added a custom classifier:

  * GlobalAveragePooling
  * Dense layer with ReLU
  * Final Dense layer with softmax for classification

*3. Training the Model:*

* Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy
* Optimizer: Adam
* Metrics: Accuracy
* Epochs: 20-30 (depending on convergence)

*4. Evaluation:*

* Confusion Matrix
* Precision, Recall, F1-Score
* Accuracy and loss curves

---

### Results

* Training Accuracy: \~95%
* Validation Accuracy: \~92%
* Model successfully differentiates between fresh and rotten produce.
* Confusion matrix shows strong performance with minimal misclassifications.

---

### Deployment (Prototype)

* The model can be deployed on Raspberry Pi connected to a camera.
* On capturing an image, the model predicts the class (Fresh/Rotten).
* The object can be sorted into bins using servo motors based on the prediction.

---

### Advantages

* Reduces manual labor and human error
* Works with a wide variety of fruits and vegetables
* Adaptable to real-time environments

---

### Conclusion

The project demonstrates an efficient and smart way of classifying and sorting fruits and vegetables using transfer learning. With the rise of automation in agriculture, such AI-based solutions can significantly reduce waste and improve food quality management.
